# Security Policy

Thank you for helping to keep **jsocketpp** (a C++17 cross-platform socket library) and its users secure!

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability or suspect a potential security issue, **please do not open a public issue or discussion**.

**Instead, please report it privately by emailing the project maintainer:**

- **Contact:** MangaD
- ~~**Email:** [INSERT_YOUR_EMAIL_HERE]~~

You may also use the [GitHub Security Advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/about-repository-security-advisories) feature if preferred.

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much of the following information as possible:
- Description of the issue and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability (if possible).
- Affected versions or commits.
- Any suggested mitigations or workarounds.

## Disclosure Policy

- We aim to acknowledge all vulnerability reports within **3 business days**.
- After triage, we will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible and may contact you for further information.
- We kindly request that you allow us a **reasonable amount of time** to develop and release a fix before publicly disclosing any details.
- Once a fix is released, we will coordinate an appropriate public disclosure with credit, if desired.

## Project Scope
