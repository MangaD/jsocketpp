 * This header is part of the jsocketpp library and declares the `SocketOptions` class, a reusable,
 * lightweight base interface for setting and retrieving low-level socket options.
 *
 * The implementation is portable across POSIX and Windows platforms.
 * It is designed to be inherited by socket classes such as `Socket`, `ServerSocket`, `DatagramSocket`,
 * and `UnixSocket`, enabling shared access to `setsockopt()` and `getsockopt()` functionality.

/**
 * @class SocketOptions
 * @brief Public base class for raw socket option access via `setsockopt()` and `getsockopt()`.
 * @ingroup socketopts
 *
 * The `SocketOptions` class provides a unified, cross-platform interface for working with
 * socket-level configuration options (e.g., `SO_REUSEADDR`, `SO_RCVBUF`, `TCP_NODELAY`).
 * It is designed to be inherited by classes that manage socket descriptors, enabling those
 * classes to expose low-level tunables without duplicating boilerplate code.
 *
 * ## Intended Usage
 * - Derived classes must pass a valid socket descriptor to the constructor of `SocketOptions`.
 * - After move construction or assignment, they must call `setSocketFd()` to update the descriptor.
 * - This class does **not** own the socket or manage its lifecycle (open, close, etc.).
 *
 * ## Supported Classes
 * - `Socket`
 * - `ServerSocket`
 * - `DatagramSocket`
 * - `UnixSocket`
 *
 * @note This class is **not thread-safe**. Access should be externally synchronized if needed.

     * @brief Sets a low-level socket option on the underlying socket.
     * @ingroup socketopts
     *
     * This method configures a socket option using the system-level `setsockopt()` interface.
     * Socket options allow advanced users to fine-tune behavior related to performance,
     * protocol semantics, and resource usage.
     *
     * This API is common to all socket types (e.g., `Socket`, `ServerSocket`, `DatagramSocket`, `UnixSocket`)
     * and supports options at multiple protocol levels, such as `SOL_SOCKET` and `IPPROTO_TCP`.
     *
     * Typical use cases include:
     * - Enabling address reuse (`SO_REUSEADDR`)
     * - Adjusting receive/send buffer sizes (`SO_RCVBUF`, `SO_SNDBUF`)
     * - Enabling/disabling keepalive (`SO_KEEPALIVE`)
     * - Disabling Nagle‚Äôs algorithm for latency-sensitive TCP (`TCP_NODELAY`)
     *
     * ### ‚ö†Ô∏è ServerSocket-specific Notes
     * - Setting options on a **listening socket** (e.g., `ServerSocket`) only affects that socket, not the
     *   client sockets returned by `accept()`. Per-connection tuning must be applied to each accepted `Socket`.
     * - Not all options are meaningful on passive (listening) sockets. Invalid combinations may result in
     *   `SocketException` or system errors.
     *
     * ### Example: Enable port reuse (recommended for servers)
     * @code
     * serverSocket.setOption(SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, 1);
     * @endcode
     *
     * ### Example: Disable Nagle‚Äôs algorithm (for latency-sensitive clients)
     * @code
     * socket.setOption(IPPROTO_TCP, TCP_NODELAY, 1);
     * @endcode
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### üì° DatagramSocket-specific Notes
     * - You can use this method to enable **broadcast mode** (`SO_BROADCAST`) or adjust buffer sizes for
     *   high-throughput UDP workloads.
     * - It also supports setting timeouts via `SO_RCVTIMEO` and `SO_SNDTIMEO`.
     * - For unconnected UDP sockets, option changes affect all outgoing/incoming packets.
     * - For connected UDP sockets, the changes affect only the single destination connection.
     *
     * #### Example: Enable broadcast for a datagram socket
     * @code
     * datagramSocket.setOption(SOL_SOCKET, SO_BROADCAST, 1);
     * @endcode
     *
     * ### üßø UnixSocket-specific Notes
     * - Although Unix domain sockets are local and do not use TCP/IP, many `SOL_SOCKET` options still apply:
     *   - `SO_RCVBUF`, `SO_SNDBUF` for buffer control
     *   - `SO_RCVTIMEO`, `SO_SNDTIMEO` for timeouts
     *   - `SO_PASSCRED` to enable credential passing (on supported platforms)
     * - Options like `TCP_NODELAY` and `SO_KEEPALIVE` do not apply to Unix sockets.
     *
     * #### Example: Set a larger send buffer for inter-process communication
     * @code
     * unixSocket.setOption(SOL_SOCKET, SO_SNDBUF, 65536);
     * @endcode
     *
     * @param level    The protocol level at which the option resides (e.g., `SOL_SOCKET`, `IPPROTO_TCP`).
     * @param optName  The name of the option to set (e.g., `SO_REUSEADDR`, `SO_RCVBUF`).
     * @param value    Integer value to assign to the option.
     *
     * @throws SocketException if the option is invalid, unsupported, or if `setsockopt()` fails.
     *
     * @see getOption()
     * @see https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/setsockopt.2.html

    void setOption(int level, int optName, int value);

    /**
     * @brief Retrieves the current value of a low-level socket option.
     * @ingroup socketopts
     *
     * This method queries the current value of a socket option via `getsockopt()` on the
     * underlying socket descriptor. It is useful for verifying runtime socket configuration,
     * inspecting platform defaults, and performing conditional logic based on system-level state.
     *
     * This interface applies uniformly across all socket types (e.g., `Socket`, `ServerSocket`,
     * `DatagramSocket`, `UnixSocket`) and supports standard protocol levels and option names.
     *
     * ### Example: Read the configured receive buffer size
     * @code
     * int rcvBuf = socket.getOption(SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF);
     * @endcode
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### ‚ö†Ô∏è ServerSocket-specific Notes
     * - `getOption()` returns the value of the option as applied to the **listening socket only**.
     * - Options like `SO_RCVBUF`, `SO_REUSEADDR`, and `SO_LINGER` are meaningful before or during `listen()`.
     * - To inspect options for a client connection, call `getOption()` on the accepted `Socket` returned by `accept()`.
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### üì° DatagramSocket-specific Notes
     * - Use `getOption()` to inspect options like buffer sizes (`SO_RCVBUF`, `SO_SNDBUF`) and timeouts
     *   (`SO_RCVTIMEO`, `SO_SNDTIMEO`) for diagnostic or tuning purposes.
     * - On broadcast-enabled sockets (`SO_BROADCAST`), this method can verify that the option was set successfully.
     * - Behavior is the same whether the socket is connected or unconnected.
     *
     * #### Example: Get current timeout for receiving
     * @code
     * int timeout = datagramSocket.getOption(SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVTIMEO);
     * @endcode
     *
     * ---
     *
     * ### üßø UnixSocket-specific Notes
     * - Although Unix domain sockets are local, many `SOL_SOCKET` options are still supported and report useful values:
     *   - `SO_RCVBUF`, `SO_SNDBUF`: Report actual system-allocated buffer sizes
     *   - `SO_RCVTIMEO`, `SO_SNDTIMEO`: Inspect timeouts for IPC calls
     *   - `SO_PASSCRED`: Check whether credential passing is enabled
     * - This method is particularly useful for debugging IPC performance characteristics.
     *
     * #### Example: Read the actual receive buffer size used for a Unix socket
     * @code
     * int size = unixSocket.getOption(SOL_SOCKET, SO_RCVBUF);
     * @endcode
     *
     * @param level   The protocol level (e.g., `SOL_SOCKET`, `IPPROTO_TCP`).
     * @param optName The name of the socket option to retrieve (e.g., `SO_RCVBUF`, `SO_KEEPALIVE`).
     * @return        The integer value of the specified socket option.
     *
     * @throws SocketException if the operation fails, the socket is invalid, or the option is not supported.

    /**
     * @brief Enables or disables the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option.
     * @ingroup socketopts
     *
     * This option controls whether the socket is permitted to bind to a local address and port
     * that is already in use or in the `TIME_WAIT` state. It is commonly used in both server
     * and client contexts, and is applicable to TCP, UDP, and Unix domain sockets.
     *
     * Internally, this method invokes:
     * @code
     * setsockopt(fd, SOL_SOCKET, SO_REUSEADDR, ...)
     * @endcode
     *
     * ### Platform Behavior
     * - **POSIX (Linux, BSD, macOS):**
     *   - Permits multiple sockets to bind the same address/port as long as all use `SO_REUSEADDR`.
     *   - Commonly used with multicast UDP, and for servers that need to restart quickly.
     * - **Windows:**
     *   - Allows rebinding to a port in `TIME_WAIT`, but does **not** allow simultaneous binds.
     *   - Microsoft recommends `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` for exclusive ownership, but `SO_REUSEADDR` works for most cases.
     *
     * ### Protocol Use Cases
     * - **TCP Server Sockets**: Enables re-binding to a port immediately after shutdown.
     * - **TCP Client Sockets**: Useful when binding to a fixed local port to reconnect rapidly.
     * - **UDP Sockets**:
     *   - Allows multiple sockets to bind to the same port, often required for multicast listeners.
     *   - Useful in P2P setups where port reuse is desired across short-lived sessions.
     * - **Unix Domain Sockets**:
     *   - On some platforms, `SO_REUSEADDR` may be ignored or unnecessary for `AF_UNIX`, since
     *     file system semantics already handle path reusability. However, setting it is harmless and may
     *     be supported by your platform for consistency.
     *
     * ### Example
     * @code
     * socket.setReuseAddress(true); // Enable port/path reuse before calling bind()
     * @endcode
     *
     * @warning This method must be called **after socket creation** and **before bind()**.
     *          Improper use can lead to security issues or interference between applications.
     *
     * @param on If `true`, enables address reuse; if `false`, disables it.
     *
     * @throws SocketException if the socket is invalid or the option cannot be set.
     *
     * @see getReuseAddress()
     * @see bind()
     * @see https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/socket.7.html

     * @ingroup socketopts
     *
     * This method retrieves the state of the `SO_REUSEADDR` socket option using `getsockopt()`.
     * When enabled, it allows the socket to bind to a local address/port that is already in use
     * or still in the `TIME_WAIT` state. This is particularly useful in scenarios such as:
     *
     * - Restartable TCP servers that must rebind quickly
     * - UDP or multicast receivers sharing the same port
     * - Clients using fixed local ports across reconnects
     *
     * ### Platform Behavior
     * - **POSIX:** Multiple sockets can bind the same local address/port if all use `SO_REUSEADDR`.
     * - **Windows:** `SO_REUSEADDR` allows rebinding to a port in `TIME_WAIT`, but does **not**
     *   allow simultaneous binds. Additionally, `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` is enabled by default
     *   and disables reuse ‚Äî this method reflects the effective state of `SO_REUSEADDR`, not
     *   `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE`.

     * ### Protocol Applicability
     * - **TCP:** Useful for both client and server sockets.
     * - **UDP:** Required for multicast and shared-port scenarios.
     * - **Unix domain sockets:** `SO_REUSEADDR` may be supported but is typically a no-op;

     * ### Applicability
     * This method is valid for all supported socket types:

     * ### Behavior
     * - **Linger enabled (`enable == true`)**:

     *
     * // Standard non-blocking close behavior
     * socket.setSoLinger(false, 0);
     * @endcode
     *
     * @param enable Whether to enable lingering behavior on close.
     * @param seconds Linger timeout (in seconds). Only meaningful if `enable == true`.
     *                - Must be ‚â• 0. `0` means abortive close.
     *
     * @throws SocketException if:
     * - The socket is invalid
     * - `setsockopt()` fails
     * - The operation is not supported on the socket type (platform-dependent)

     * Queries the operating system for the current linger behavior configured
     * on this socket. Linger settings determine whether the socket blocks on
     * `close()` to allow unsent data to be transmitted, or terminates the
     * connection immediately (potentially discarding unsent data).

     * ### üîÅ Applicability
     * - ‚úÖ **TCP sockets (`Socket`)**: Fully supported; reflects actual linger settings.
     * - ‚úÖ **UNIX domain stream sockets**: Supported on most POSIX platforms.
     * - ‚ö†Ô∏è **UDP / datagram sockets (`DatagramSocket`)**: `SO_LINGER` is silently ignored by most systems.
     * - ‚ö†Ô∏è **ServerSocket**: Applies only to the passive (listening) socket. To inspect accepted clients,

     * auto [enabled, timeout] = socket.getSoLinger();
     * if (enabled)
     *     std::cout << "Linger is enabled for " << timeout << " seconds.\n";

     * This method sets the internal socket file descriptor used by the `SocketOptions` interface.

     * otherwise changed during the object's lifetime.
     *
     * This does **not** open, close, or validate the socket descriptor. It simply updates the

     *
     * ### When to Use
     * - After a move constructor or move assignment updates the underlying socket
     * - After explicitly re-binding or re-creating a socket file descriptor
     * - When adapting an externally provided descriptor (e.g., from `accept()` or `socketpair()`)
     *
     * ### Example: Move assignment
     * @code
     * _sockFd = rhs._sockFd;
     * setSocketFd(_sockFd); // keeps SocketOptions base class in sync
     * @endcode
     *
     * @param sock The new socket file descriptor to associate with this object. May be `INVALID_SOCKET`
     *             to mark the socket as uninitialized or closed.
     *
     * @note This method does not perform error checking. It is the caller's responsibility to ensure
     *       the provided descriptor is valid and consistent with the derived class state.

     *
     * This virtual method is used internally by the `SocketOptions` interface to determine whether
     * the socket is operating in a *passive role* ‚Äî that is, it is a listening socket typically created
     * by a server to accept incoming connections. This distinction is particularly relevant on platforms
     * like Windows, where different socket options apply to passive vs. active sockets.
     *
     * Specifically, this affects how address reuse logic is applied:
     * - On Windows, `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` is used for passive sockets to control port reuse semantics.
     * - On POSIX systems, all sockets use `SO_REUSEADDR`, but server sockets may still follow different best practices.
     *
     * ### Usage
     * - Override this method in subclasses like `ServerSocket` to return `true`.
     * - Leave it as `false` (default) in client sockets, UDP sockets, or Unix domain sockets.
     *
     * @return `true` if the socket is used in a listening or acceptor role; `false` otherwise.
     *
     * @note This method has no direct side effects. It exists purely to guide conditional logic in reusable
     *       base class operations such as `setReuseAddress()` and `getReuseAddress()`.
