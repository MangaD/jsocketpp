/**
 * @class ServerSocket
 * @ingroup tcp
 * @brief TCP server socket abstraction for cross-platform C++ networking.
 *
 * The `ServerSocket` class provides a high-level, Java-like interface to create TCP server sockets in C++17,
 * supporting both IPv4 and IPv6, and working on both Windows and Unix-like systems.
 *
 * ## Overview
 * `ServerSocket` is designed to simplify the creation of network server applications. It allows you to:
 * - Bind to a specified port (optionally on a specific address/interface)
 * - Listen for incoming connections
 * - Accept client connections as new `Socket` objects
 * - Clean up resources automatically (RAII)
 *
 * This class handles platform differences (such as Winsock vs BSD Sockets) internally, so you can write portable code.
 *
 * ## Typical Usage
 * Hereâ€™s how you can use `ServerSocket` to create a simple TCP echo server:
 *
 * @code{.cpp}
 * #include <jsocketpp/ServerSocket.hpp>
 * #include <jsocketpp/Socket.hpp>
 * #include <iostream>
 *
 * int main() {
 *     try {
 *         // Create a server socket listening on port 12345 (all interfaces, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6)
 *         ServerSocket server(12345);
 *         server.bind();
 *         server.listen();
 *         std::cout << "Server is listening on port 12345..." << std::endl;
 *
 *         while (true) {
 *             Socket client = server.accept();
 *             std::string remoteAddr = client.getRemoteSocketAddress();
 *             std::cout << "Accepted connection from " << remoteAddr << std::endl;
 *
 *             // Echo loop: read a string, send it back
 *             std::string message = client.read<std::string>();
 *             client.write(message);
 *         }
 *     } catch (const socket_exception& e) {
 *         std::cerr << "Server error: " << e.what() << std::endl;
 *     }
 *     return 0;
 * }
 * @endcode
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - **Cross-platform**: Windows and Linux/Unix support
 * - **IPv4 & IPv6**: Automatic dual-stack support if available
 * - **Resource management**: RAII ensures sockets are closed automatically
 * - **Error handling**: Throws exceptions on error for robust applications
 * - **Customizable**: Control backlog, address reuse, blocking/non-blocking modes, etc.
 *
 * ## Basic API
 * - `ServerSocket(port)`: Construct with a port to listen on.
 * - `bind()`: Bind the server to the selected address and port.
 * - `listen()`: Start listening for connections.
 * - `accept()`: Accept a new client and return a `Socket`.
 * - `close()`: Close the server socket (also called automatically in destructor).
 *
 * ## Notes
 * - After calling `accept()`, you should use the returned `Socket` object to communicate with the client.
 * - The server socket only accepts TCP connections. Use `DatagramSocket` for UDP.
 * - Exceptions are thrown as `SocketException` for error conditions.
 *

     *

     *   need to restart and rebind to their previous address immediately.

     *       - On Windows, uses SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE to prevent port hijacking.
