# Comparison: `libsocket` vs Other C++ Socket Libraries

This document compares `libsocket` to other popular C++ libraries that provide socket functionality. It highlights the advantages and disadvantages of each, helping users choose the right tool for their needs.

---

## 1. libsocket (this library)

**Overview:**
- Modern C++17 cross-platform abstraction for TCP, UDP, and Unix sockets.
- Java-like API for ease of use.
- Supports Windows, Linux, and POSIX systems.
- Focuses on simplicity, exception safety, and clear error reporting.

**Advantages:**
- Simple, consistent API across platforms.
- Exception-based error handling.
- Modern C++ idioms (RAII, smart pointers, std::string, etc.).
- Supports both stream (TCP) and datagram (UDP) sockets, plus Unix domain sockets.
- Designed for easy integration with CMake, Conan, and vcpkg.

**Disadvantages:**
- Not as feature-rich as some larger frameworks (e.g., no async/event loop, SSL/TLS, or HTTP built-in).
- Smaller user base and ecosystem compared to Boost or ASIO.
- No built-in support for advanced networking protocols.

## 2. Boost.Asio

**Overview:**
- Part of the Boost C++ Libraries.
- Provides low-level and high-level networking (TCP, UDP, serial ports, timers, etc.).
- Supports synchronous and asynchronous I/O.

**Advantages:**
- Very powerful and flexible.
- Asynchronous/event-driven programming support.
- Large user base and extensive documentation.
- Can be used with or without Boost dependencies (header-only in recent versions).
- SSL/TLS support via OpenSSL.

**Disadvantages:**
- Steeper learning curve due to complexity.
- More boilerplate for simple use cases.
- Error handling is not exception-based by default (uses error_code pattern).
- May be overkill for simple socket needs.

## 3. Poco::Net

**Overview:**
- Part of the POCO C++ Libraries.
- Provides networking, HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and more.
- Object-oriented, high-level API.

**Advantages:**
- High-level abstractions for many protocols (HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.).
- Good documentation and active development.
- Cross-platform.

**Disadvantages:**
- Larger dependency footprint.
- More complex build and integration process.
- May be too heavyweight for projects needing only basic sockets.

---

## 4. Qt Network Module

**Overview:**
- Part of the Qt framework.
- Provides TCP, UDP, SSL, HTTP, and WebSockets.
- Integrates with Qt's event loop and signal/slot system.

**Advantages:**
- Seamless integration with Qt applications.
- High-level, event-driven API.
- SSL/TLS and HTTP support.

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires Qt (large dependency, not always suitable for non-GUI projects).
- Not header-only; requires Qt build system.
- Not ideal for non-Qt projects.

---

## 5. Native BSD/POSIX/WinSock APIs

**Overview:**
- Direct use of system socket APIs (e.g., `socket()`, `bind()`, `connect()`, etc.).

**Advantages:**
- Maximum control and performance.
- No dependencies.
- Universally available.

**Disadvantages:**
- Verbose and error-prone.
- Platform differences require many `#ifdef`s.
- No abstraction for resource management (manual cleanup required).
- No exception safety or modern C++ features.

## Conclusion

- Use **libsocket** for simple, modern, cross-platform socket programming with minimal dependencies.
- Use **Boost.Asio** or **Poco::Net** for advanced networking, async/event-driven code, or protocol support.
- Use **Qt Network** if you are already using Qt.
- Use **native APIs** only if you need maximum control and are comfortable handling platform differences.

Choose the library that best fits your project's needs and complexity!
