# We use `select` for asynchronous I/O operations. Does it make sense to provide `poll` and `epoll` as alternatives?

### 1. **Why `select` is Used**

* **Portability:** `select` is available on both POSIX (Linux, macOS, BSD, etc.) and Windows (as `select()` in Winsock),
  making it the lowest common denominator for cross-platform socket libraries.
* **Simple APIs:** Easy to use for a small number of sockets.

---

### 2. **Drawbacks of `select`**

* **Limited file descriptors:** On many systems, `select` is limited to 1024 file descriptors (FD\_SETSIZE), which
  restricts scalability for servers handling many connections.
* **Performance:** Scanning all file descriptors is inefficient for a large number of sockets.
* **Inefficiency:** Rebuilding the FD sets on every call can be expensive for many descriptors.

---

### 3. **Advantages of `poll`**

* **No hard FD limit:** `poll` works with arbitrary file descriptor values and isn’t limited by FD\_SETSIZE.
* **Slightly better scaling:** The API is a bit more modern than `select`.
* **Availability:** Available on almost all POSIX systems (not native on Windows).

---

### 4. **Advantages of `epoll`**

* **Scalability:** `epoll` (Linux only) is highly scalable, efficient for thousands of sockets (O(1) wakeups).
* **Edge/level triggered:** More flexible event models.
* **Event-driven servers:** The industry standard for high-performance Linux network servers.

---

### 5. **Windows Counterparts**

* **WSAPoll:** Since Windows Vista, Winsock provides `WSAPoll` (similar to POSIX `poll`), but there is no native `epoll`
  equivalent. For high-performance on Windows, use I/O completion ports (IOCP).

---

### 6. **Cross-Platform API Considerations**

If your library’s goal is **simple, Java-like, cross-platform sockets**, here are the usual trade-offs:

* For **simple sockets and connection timeouts**, `select` suffices and works everywhere.
* If you want to support **high-performance servers**, it’s beneficial to provide an abstraction over:

    * `select` (default, portable)
    * `poll` (if available)
    * `epoll` (Linux)
    * IOCP (Windows, advanced)
* **Java NIO** does this via the `Selector` API, abstracting over the platform details.

---

### 7. **Practical Recommendations**

* **For most applications:** Using `select` (as you do now) is fine and maximizes portability.
* **For advanced/massively concurrent servers:** Exposing `poll`/`epoll`/IOCP as optional APIs is a great enhancement.
* **How to design:**

    * Provide an **abstract “Selector” or “EventLoop” class** with a runtime-chosen backend (select/poll/epoll/IOCP).
    * Users needing performance can opt-in; everyone else uses the default.

### 8. **Summary Table**

| Feature     | select  | poll | epoll     | WSAPoll | IOCP      |
|-------------|---------|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| POSIX       | ✔️      | ✔️   | Linux     | ❌       | ❌         |
| Windows     | ✔️      | ❌    | ❌         | ✔️      | ✔️        |
| Scalability | Limited | OK   | Excellent | OK      | Excellent |
| Simplicity  | Simple  | OK   | Advanced  | OK      | Advanced  |

### 9. **Conclusion / Advice**

* **Keep select** for basic API and portability.
* **Optionally** add support for `poll`, `epoll`, or IOCP for advanced users.
* **If you want a Java-like interface**, consider a class like `Selector` with backend selection, and document the
  differences per platform.
